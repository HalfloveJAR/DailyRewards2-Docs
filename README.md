## Supported Versions

Daily Rewards 2 comes with two jar files in a zip file when downloaded. One jar is built using the Spigot API, the other is built using the Paper API. The Spigot version might work on paper servers, but it is not recommended as Paper is no longer guaranteeing parity with Spigot plugins as of 1.21.3.

### For Paper / Folia Servers

If you are running a Paper, Paper fork, or Folia server, you should use the Paper version of Daily Rewards 2. The paper version of the plugin is built using the Paper 1.21.6 API, it may work with earlier versions, however, this is not guaranteed nor is it recommended. For older versions, you might want to consider using the Spigot build.

**Versions Supported: 1.21.6 - 1.21.7**

### For Spigot Servers

If you are running a basic Spigot server, I recommend you should swap to Paper or a Paper fork instead. If you would still rather use Spigot, you should use the Spigot version of Daily Rewards 2, the Paper build will not work. The Spigot version of this plugin is built using the Spigot 1.20 API, but it should still work all the way up to the latest version of Spigot as of the time of writing this.

**Versions Supported: 1.20 - 1.21.7**
